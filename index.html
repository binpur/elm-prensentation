1. What is Elm
2. How to build a web app frontend with Elm

# What is Elm
    A language that compiles to Javascript
    Purely functional(it’s not object-oriented!)
    All variables are immutable
    Strong typed
    Current version: 0.18

---

# Why Elm?
    Because Javascript does not compile, so it’s run-time error-prone

# Elm types (1)
    Data types
        Primitives (Boolean, String, Int, Float…),
        Functions,
        List (values should have same type),
        Tuple,
        Record(key-value pairs, like object)

    Create your own type with Type Alias
        To create type Document:
    ```type alias Document = { id: String, title: String, type: String}
    ``` To create a record with type Document:
        Document "id_123" "Sell a iphone” “classified”

    Union Type
        type DocType = Classified | Dating | Message
        > type alias Document = { id: String, title: String, type: DocType}
        > Document "id_123" "Sell a iphone” Classified

---

# Elm types (2)
    >type alias ClassifiedInfo= {id: String, price: Float}
    >type alias DatingInfo = {id: String, age: Int}
    >type alias MessageInfo = {id: String, title: String}

    >type Document = Classified ClassifiedInfo | Dating DatingInfo | Message MessageInfo
    > Classified (ClassifiedInfo "id_123" 999.9)
    Classified { id = "id_123", price = 999.9 } : Repl.Document
---

# Elm types (3)
There is no “null” or “undefined” in Elm.

But there is “Maybe”.
You can create a Maybe value using Nothing or Just constructor.

Type alias User = {name: String, age: Maybe Int}
userA = {name= “Alice”, age= Nothing},
userB = {name= “Bob”, age= Just 30}

canBuyAlcohol: User —> Bool
canBuyAlcohol user =
  Case user.age of
Nothing -> False
Just age -> age >= 21

# How to write a web app frontend with Elm
.center[![husky](http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/shaved-husky-dog-frontend-backend-explained-comparison.jpg)]

---

# First of all you need a index.html

    ```

```
---

# Then you can start writing Elm code
    div []
    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
    , div [] [ text (toString model) ]
    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
    ]

    Elm has a library called elm-lang/html that gives you full access to HTML5 as normal Elm functions

---
# Can I still use javascript libraries?
    Yes. You can use "port" to communicate between the JavaScript land and the Elm land.

---
# Summary
    The good part about Elm:
        No runtime errors in practice.
        Friendly error messages that help you add features more quickly.
        It's easy to learn
    The not-so-good part:
        You cannot access the rendered DOM from Elm, by design. You need to go back to the Javascript land.
        You will end up writing a lot of JSON decoders.
        Elm has a small community.
